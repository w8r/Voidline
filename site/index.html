<p>Voidline aims to be a revolutionary knowledge engine that perfectly blends a social knowledge platform, a visually navigable hyper-encyclopedia, 
and a knowledge computation engine into a single integrated system.</p>

<p>The system would have an extensive database of virtually everything: material and abstract entities, their properties, concepts, behaviors, and theories, 
based on empirical data. This database would be properly organized using an advanced ontology framework, that would accurately describe every item's 
relation to one another. It is basically, the long sought after, taxonomy of everything.</p>

<p>The community can easily contribute to the database, by submitting new items to the database, which would be moderated, like the rest of the database, 
via the democratic process of voting. Wherever it applies, the information would be empirically supported or contradicted by the community. 
The system highly encourages any type of scientific research, allowing for new, yet-to-be studied information to be submitted and researched by the community.</p>

<p>This knowledge database will be presented visually and intuitively, in the form of a complete tree or graph of everything. A user can navigate by panning 
and zooming through this "tree of everything", up to the whole big picture of how everything relates to each other, and down to the most specific and remote 
item in the system. Users will also be able to extract and navigate customized graphs based on smaller information sets, that would pinpoint a particular 
concept or context.</p>

<p>Every user's contribution is rewarded with experience points which build up to levels of experience and merit badges on their profiles. Users can also 
start discussions, ask questions and interact with each other socially.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the system would implement a natural language processing engine and a knowledge computation engine, thus allowing users to easily search for 
information, using regular, semantic English language, and retrieve highly accurate information computed by the knowledge engine.</p>

<p>This is an idealistic endeavor which requires a huge amount of both financial and intellectual resources. It is a project for the human kind, that's only 
possible through the joint effort of the human kind.</p>
