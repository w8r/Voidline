<div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 650px;">
<p>There have been a number of somewhat tangential projects, that more or less intersect with Voidline's goals.</p>

<p>To begin with, our current most powerful information tools are well-known: Google and Wikipedia.</p>

<p><strong>Google</strong>, while it has improved its searching algorithm over time, it still just retrieves a hoard of information (from the actual hoard that is the 
Interweb), and even the relevance of that information is highly affected by the commercial nature of the web.</p>

<p><strong>Wikipedia</strong> is currently the best information tool we've got. It is also based on crowdsourcing, where everybody contributes to the general knowledge. 
Unfortunately, it almost completely lacks any form of taxonomy or classification, so you can only read about a specific thing, being left in the dark as to 
how that thing fits in its context. Also, it is only intended for humans, and its information structure does not allow to be interpreted by machines.</p>

<p>So we would need something better than that.</p>

<p>There currently are a few projects (which have existed for a while) that try to improve knowledge organization or interpretation:</p>

<p><strong>DBpedia</strong> (<a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/About">http://wiki.dbpedia.org/About</a>)<br />
"DBpedia is a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and make this information available on the Web."</p>

<p><strong>Freebase</strong> (<a href="http://www.freebase.com">http://www.freebase.com</a>)<br />
"Freebase is a community-curated database of well-known people, places, and things"

<p><strong>YAHO</strong> (<a href="http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago/">http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago/</a>)<br />
"YAGO is a huge semantic knowledge base, derived from Wikipedia, WordNet and GeoNames."

<p><strong>Wordnet</strong> (<a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">http://wordnet.princeton.edu/</a>)<br />
"WordNet® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept."

<p><strong>SUMO</strong> (<a href="http://www.ontologyportal.org/">http://www.ontologyportal.org/</a>)<br />
"The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) and its domain ontologies form the largest formal public ontology in existence today. They are being used for research and applications in search, linguistics and reasoning."

<p><strong>OpenCyc</strong> (<a href="http://www.cyc.com/platform/opencyc">http://www.cyc.com/platform/opencyc</a>)<br />
"The OpenCyc Platform is your gateway to the full power of Cyc, the world's largest and most complete general knowledge base and commonsense reasoning engine."

<p><strong>Mindpixel</strong> (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mindpix/">http://code.google.com/p/mindpix/</a>)<br />
"Mindpixel was a web-based collaborative artificial intelligence project which aimed to create a knowledgebase of millions of human validated true/false statements, or probabilistic propositions. It ran from 2000 to 2005."

<p><strong>Open Mind Common Sense</strong> (<a href="http://csc.media.mit.edu/">http://csc.media.mit.edu/</a>)<br />
"Open Mind Common Sense is a project started in 1999 at MIT, aiming to collect common sense from volunteers on the internet. Currently, the English site has over a million sentences from over 15,000 contributors."

<p><strong>UMBEL</strong> (<a href="http://umbel.org/">http://umbel.org/</a>)<br />
"UMBEL - Vocabulary and Reference Concept Ontology is the Upper Mapping and Binding Exchange Layer, designed to help content interoperate on the Web."

<p><strong>OpenCog</strong> (<a href="http://wiki.opencog.org/w/The_Open_Cognition_Project">http://wiki.opencog.org/w/The_Open_Cognition_Project</a>)<br />
"OpenCog is an effort to create an open source Artificial General Intelligence framework, intended to one day express general intelligence at the human level and beyond."

<p><strong>The Penn Treebank Project</strong> (<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/</a>)<br />
"The Penn Treebank Project annotates naturally-occuring text for linguistic structure. Most notably, we produce skeletal parses showing rough syntactic and semantic information -- a bank of linguistic trees."

<p><strong>BabelNet</strong> (<a href="http://babelnet.org">http://babelnet.org</a>)<br />
"BabelNet is both a multilingual encyclopedic dictionary, with lexicographic and encyclopedic coverage of terms in 50 languages, and an ontology which connects concepts and named entities in a very large network of semantic relations"

<p><strong>WikiData</strong> (<a href="http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page</a>)<br />
"Wikidata is a free knowledge base that can be read and edited by humans and machines alike. It is for data what Wikimedia Commons is for media files: it centralizes access to and management of structured data, such as interwiki references and statistical information."

<p>Most of these are open, collaborative efforts with goals somewhat tangent to ours. We look at all of them with great admiration. Some of them might represent a very solid foundation that we can use to build Voidline upon. However, none have the exact vision that we do.

<p>There are also a few attempts by big companies at this:

<p><strong>Google Knowledge Graph</strong> (<a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html">http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html</a>)<br />
It has a nice video presentation, which remebles very very closely the way we want to visualize data. In a visual, inter-connected graph. However, in practice it's not that at all. Google's "Knowledge Graph" is actually just "a carousel at the top of the results page", and a sidebar that shows up on a narrow set of people, places and items, that displays information from Wikipedia and lets you know what related items people searched for.

<p><strong>Evi</strong> (<a href="http://evi.com/">http://evi.com/</a>)<br />
"Evi was founded in August 2005, originally under the name of True Knowledge, with the mission of powering a new kind of search experience where users can access the world’s knowledge simply by asking for the information they need in a way that is completely natural."
It has a simple natural processing system, and an internal knowledge computation engine, but it is not transparent, and you can only interact with it by searching specific terms or questions.

<p><strong>Wolfram|Alpha</strong> (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">http://www.wolframalpha.com/</a>)<br />
"Wolfram|Alpha aims to collect and curate all objective data; implement every known model, method, and algorithm; and make it possible to compute whatever can be computed about anything."

<p>That does sound perfect, and is one of the huge goals that Voidline aims to as well. Upon testing, Wolfram|Alpha is indeed, quite powerful, but of course, is limited. Given the history of the company, most of the power in Wolfram|Alpha lies in mathematical computation, than in actual ontologic connections. Also, like Evi, it is not a transparent system, and you can only interact with its database by searching.</p>
